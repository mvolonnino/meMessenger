# MeMessenger!

##### an iMessage clone :)

## ABOUT

This project is a working clone of the popular iMessage application for desktop. It is a fun way to get people together and talking to anyone they would like.

It allows a user to sign in with Google Authentication and be able to message anyone in any chat channel.

Inspiration came from the widely popular iMessage design with some cool UI changes and important details. The application shows whose signed in the top Sidebar Header. It gives details on who is in the chat channel by a user's email (very easy to change to anything else from Google Auth). A user can create a new channel and name it whatever he or she would like and begin messaging in it. Every user will have access to each chat channel which makes it a fun way to meet new people, especially during the COVID 19 Pandemic, where more and more people are forced to stay indoors.

## Cool UI

- verified user ID in Sibebar Header
- User sign out function from Sidebar Header Avatar
- Persistant sign in feature utilizing Google Authentication
- Cant send message unless a Chat Channel has been selected
- 3 dots on right side of Chat Header works as 'details" button and shows a list of unique emails in the chat (no duplicate emails) and total # of messages in the Chat Channel
- Overflow scrolling so page is always the size of the viewport making it feel more like an actual 'Messager App'
